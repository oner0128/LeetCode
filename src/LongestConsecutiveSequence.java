/**
 * Created by rrr on 2017/4/5.
 * 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
 * For example,
 * Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
 * The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.
 * Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
 * //自己完全想不出来

public class LongestConsecutiveSequence {
    /*We will use HashMap. The key thing is to keep track of the sequence length and store that in the boundary points of the sequence.
     For example, as a result, for sequence {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, map.get(1) and map.get(5) should both return 5.
    Whenever a new element n is inserted into the map, do two things:
     1.See if n - 1 and n + 1 exist in the map, and if so, it means there is an existing sequence next to n.
    Variables left and right will be the length of those two sequences,
    while 0 means there is no sequence and n will be the boundary point later.
    Store (left + right + 1) as the associated value to key n into the map.
     2.Use left and right to locate the other end of the sequences to the left and right of n respectively,
    and replace the value with the new length.
    Everything inside the for loop is O(1) so the total time is O(n). Please comment if you see something wrong. Thanks.*/
